INF3110 - Mandatory 2 - ROBOL Language
==============

Mandatory 2 is writing a very simple compilator for the language 
ROBOL. The compilator is to be written in Standard ML. The project 
is just the same as inf3110_oblig1, with the only difference that 
this one is written in Standard ML instead of Java.
